# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Stack Navigator is a guided decision-making tool and code generator that helps developers and founders choose the right technology stack for their SaaS projects. Instead of overwhelming users with endless options or charging hundreds of dollars for basic boilerplate code, Stack Navigator provides a simple wizard that asks contextual questions about project needs, team size, and growth stage, then generates a fully integrated starter repository with the recommended technologies pre-configured and working together.

The tool eliminates decision paralysis by providing opinionated, stage-appropriate recommendations backed by real-world usage data, while outputting production-ready code that users can immediately build upon.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer or founder starting a new SaaS project, I want to answer a series of guided questions about my project needs, so that I can get personalized technology stack recommendations without having to research dozens of options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the Stack Navigator THEN the system SHALL present a clean, step-by-step wizard interface
2. WHEN a user progresses through the wizard THEN the system SHALL ask contextual questions about authentication needs, database requirements, hosting preferences, payment processing, and monitoring needs
3. WHEN a user answers each question THEN the system SHALL provide brief explanations of why certain options are recommended for their specific context
4. WHEN a user completes the wizard THEN the system SHALL display a summary of their recommended stack with reasoning for each choice
5. IF a user wants to modify their choices THEN the system SHALL allow them to go back and change answers with updated recommendations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who has completed the stack selection wizard, I want to download a fully configured starter repository with all my chosen technologies integrated, so that I can start building my application immediately without spending days on boilerplate setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes the stack selection THEN the system SHALL generate a complete Next.js project with all selected technologies pre-integrated
2. WHEN the code is generated THEN the system SHALL include proper TypeScript configurations, environment variable templates, and integration helpers for each selected service
3. WHEN the repository is created THEN the system SHALL include working authentication flows, database connections, payment processing setup, and monitoring configurations based on user selections
4. WHEN a user downloads the code THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive README with setup instructions, deployment steps, and links to create accounts for each required service
5. WHEN the generated code is run locally THEN the system SHALL ensure all integrations work together without additional configuration beyond adding API keys

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user evaluating different technology options, I want to understand the tradeoffs and reasoning behind each recommendation, so that I can make informed decisions about my technology stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system presents technology options THEN it SHALL include brief explanations of when each option is most appropriate
2. WHEN a user hovers over or clicks on a technology choice THEN the system SHALL display additional context about pricing, complexity, and scaling characteristics
3. WHEN the system makes a default recommendation THEN it SHALL explain why this option is suggested for the user's specific context (team size, stage, requirements)
4. WHEN a user selects a non-default option THEN the system SHALL acknowledge the choice and explain any implications or additional considerations
5. WHEN the final stack is presented THEN the system SHALL include a summary of the overall architecture and how the pieces work together

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer who wants to customize the generated code, I want the boilerplate to follow modern best practices and be easily extensible, so that I can build upon it without having to refactor the foundation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL use current versions of all dependencies and follow established patterns for each technology
2. WHEN the project structure is created THEN the system SHALL organize code in a logical, scalable folder structure with clear separation of concerns
3. WHEN integration code is written THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling, type safety, and security best practices
4. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN the system SHALL include proper validation, authentication middleware, and response formatting
5. WHEN the codebase is delivered THEN the system SHALL include examples of common patterns (CRUD operations, user management, subscription handling) that users can extend

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who needs to deploy my application, I want clear deployment instructions and configuration for my chosen hosting platform, so that I can get my application live without deployment headaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a hosting platform THEN the system SHALL include platform-specific configuration files (vercel.json, railway.json, etc.)
2. WHEN deployment instructions are provided THEN the system SHALL include step-by-step guides for connecting repositories, setting environment variables, and configuring webhooks
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL ensure all integrations (databases, authentication, payments) work in the production environment
4. WHEN environment variables are documented THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions on where to obtain each required API key or configuration value
5. WHEN the deployment is complete THEN the system SHALL include instructions for common post-deployment tasks like setting up domain names, SSL certificates, and monitoring

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user exploring Stack Navigator, I want to see examples of what the generated code looks like and understand the quality of the output, so that I can evaluate whether this tool meets my needs before going through the full wizard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the landing page THEN the system SHALL display sample code snippets and file structures from generated projects
2. WHEN examples are shown THEN the system SHALL highlight key integrations and demonstrate how different technologies work together
3. WHEN a user wants to preview output THEN the system SHALL provide a way to see example repositories or live demos of generated applications
4. WHEN code quality is demonstrated THEN the system SHALL show that generated code includes proper TypeScript types, error handling, and security practices
5. WHEN users evaluate the tool THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about what technologies are supported and what types of applications can be built
