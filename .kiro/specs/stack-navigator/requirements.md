# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Stack Navigator is a conversational AI-powered tool and code generator that helps developers and founders choose the right technology stack for their SaaS projects. Instead of overwhelming users with endless options or charging hundreds of dollars for basic boilerplate code, Stack Navigator provides an intelligent AI architect that conducts natural conversations about project needs, team size, and growth stage, then generates a fully integrated starter repository with the recommended technologies pre-configured and working together.

The tool eliminates decision paralysis by providing opinionated, stage-appropriate recommendations backed by real-world usage data, while outputting production-ready code that users can immediately build upon.
