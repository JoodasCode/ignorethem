## Questions to Consider

### Business Model
1. **What's the primary goal?**
   - Lead generation (emails)?
   - Direct conversions to paid?
   - Brand awareness?

2. **What's an acceptable cost per lead?**
   - If email = lead, is $0.09 per email reasonable?
   - Industry standard: $1-5 per qualified lead

3. **How will paid tier work?**
   - Monthly subscription?
   - Pay per stack?
   - Team features?

### User Experience
1. **What creates the best first impression?**
   - Generous limits that wow users?
   - Clear, upfront expectations?

2. **When should we ask for email?**
   - Before showing recommendations?
   - Only when downloading?
   - Optional throughout?

3. **How do we handle power users in free tier?**
   - Let them use it fully once?
   - Gradually restrict?
   - Immediate upgrade prompts?

### Technical Considerations
1. **What's easiest to implement?**
   - Message counting is simple
   - Time-based is complex
   - IP-based has privacy concerns

2. **How do we prevent abuse?**
   - Rate limiting per IP?
   - Content filtering?
   - Session limits?

3. **What metrics do we need?**
   - Conversion rates by limit type?
   - User satisfaction scores?
   - Cost per conversion?
